"""
A significant regression equation was found for novel UE hand movement patterns (F(1,9) = 37.61, p < 0.001), with an R2 of 0.84, but not found for novel UE arm movement patterns. CUE-T scores increased by 12.9 points for each 0.1 increase in mean novel UE hand movement score. Our results indicate that the novel UE movement pattern detection model accurately predicts UE function from a clinical assessment of hand movements in a sample of 10 participants with cervical SCI. 

Novelty detection outcomes may be a robust wearable sensor biomarker to identify different or new movements and monitor function over time. Novelty detection may also aid in the development of personalized care plans to optimize rehabilitation interventions for individuals with cervical SCI.
